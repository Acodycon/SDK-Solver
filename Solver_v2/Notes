# TODO(implement solving in the background)
#      i.e.: Don't use the same functions for both showing alg and not showing alg,
#            meaning implement the background solving equivalents of the normal solving algorithms,
#            so that it goes a lot faster
#      implement a stop algorithm button
# Ideas:
# Webscrapers to scrape sudoku boards from websites like sudoku.com to instantly copy the boards into the program
# Maybe implement a funtion to automatically solve given sudokus on the website, pass that solve on to it, refresh and solve the next one.
# Basically farming
